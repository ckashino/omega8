  8-bit general data register instructions:

    instructions on general 8-bit data registers are of the format:
      XXXXXRRR, where XXXXX is the instruction, and RRR is the destination register
    
    these include:
      opcode:   desc.:                args:           result:
      00000RRR  set zero              None            RRR <- 0
      00001RRR  immidiate add         D (8-bits)      RRR <- RRR + D
